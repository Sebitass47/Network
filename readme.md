This is a course project from CS50 where I make a social media without images. *You can create an account, create posts, follow people, give "likes" and see the user's profile.*

This project uses **Django, SQLite, HTML, CSS and Javascript.**

You can see all the functions in this [video](https://youtu.be/wxzWWfacsd4).
